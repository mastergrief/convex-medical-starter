# SPRINT

## META-PROMPT
[Read /DOCUMENTS/AUDIT.MD then create and implement detailed plan to craft a comprehensive markdown file called SPRINT.md in /DOCUMENTS. This file is intended as a plan of best action for development/implementation based on AUDIT.md and should be structured into development cycles called sprints, these will be ordered on priority, based on function and importance to MVP and to original PRD.md spec. ULTRATHINK]

## EXECUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Read /DOCUMENTS/AUDIT.MD
- Extract current system state and completion percentage
- Identify all critical issues, gaps, and recommendations
- Document what works, what doesn't, what's missing
- Note PRD compliance gaps and priorities
- Understand technical debt and architectural issues

### Step 2: Create and implement detailed plan
**ENGAGE ULTRATHINK FOR MAXIMUM REASONING**

Analyze audit findings to determine:
- **MVP Boundaries** - Absolute minimum for launch
- **Critical Path** - What blocks everything else
- **Quick Wins** - High impact, low effort items
- **Technical Dependencies** - Build order requirements
- **Risk Factors** - What could derail progress

### Step 3: Structure into development cycles called sprints
**Organize work into logical sprint cycles:**

Each sprint should be:
- **Time-boxed** - Typically 1-2 week cycles
- **Themed** - Focused on specific objectives
- **Measurable** - Clear success criteria
- **Achievable** - Realistic scope with buffer

Sprint Structure Pattern:
- Sprint 1: Critical Fixes & Foundation
- Sprint 2: Core MVP Features
- Sprint 3: Essential Workflows
- Sprint 4: PRD Compliance
- Sprint 5: Polish & Optimization
- Sprint N: Future Enhancements

### Step 4: Order on priority
**Based on function and importance to MVP and to original PRD.md spec**

Priority Framework:
1. **Function Criticality**
   - System-breaking issues (P0)
   - Core functionality blockers
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data integrity issues

2. **MVP Importance**
   - Authentication & authorization
   - Core business logic
   - Essential user journeys
   - Minimum viable UI/UX

3. **PRD.md Specification Alignment**
   - Must-have features (per PRD)
   - Should-have features
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Future considerations

### Step 5: Craft a comprehensive markdown file called SPRINT.md
**Create /DOCUMENTS/SPRINT.md as plan of best action for development/implementation**

```markdown
# Development Sprint Plan

Purpose: Plan of best action for development/implementation

## Executive Summary
- Current State: [X]% complete (from audit)
- Target State: MVP by Sprint [X], Full PRD by Sprint [Y]
- Total Sprints: [count]
- Timeline: [estimated weeks]

## Sprint Overview
| Sprint | Theme | Priority Focus | Duration | MVP Critical | PRD Alignment |
|--------|-------|---------------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Theme] | P0-P1 | [weeks] | Yes/No | [%] |
| [Complete sprint mapping based on audit findings] |

## Detailed Sprint Plans

### Sprint 1: [Theme based on audit findings]
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2] based on function criticality
**Duration:** [timeframe]
**MVP Impact:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**PRD Alignment:** [Which PRD requirements addressed]

#### Objectives (from audit findings)
- Fix: [critical issue from audit]
- Implement: [missing MVP feature from audit]
- Improve: [enhancement from audit]

#### User Stories
1. **[Priority] [Story Name]**
   - Audit Finding: [reference to audit issue]
   - PRD Requirement: [reference to PRD spec]
   - Acceptance Criteria: [specific measurable outcomes]
   - Implementation Notes: [technical approach]

#### Tasks
- [ ] [Task derived from audit finding]
  - Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3]
  - Complexity: [points/hours]
  - Dependencies: [what must be done first]

#### Success Metrics
- [Measurable outcome based on audit gaps]
- [Test coverage target]
- [Performance benchmark]

### Sprint 2: [Continue pattern for each sprint]
[Structure subsequent sprints based on audit priorities]

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Definition (based on audit)
Core features required for minimum viable product:
- [Feature 1 - from audit gaps]
- [Feature 2 - from audit gaps]
- [Essential workflows identified in audit]

### PRD Compliance Path
Mapping from current state (audit) to full PRD:
| PRD Requirement | Current State | Target Sprint | Priority |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| [from audit] | [% complete] | Sprint [X] | [P0-P3] |

### Technical Debt Resolution
Addressing issues identified in audit:
- [Debt item]: Sprint [X] - [approach]
- [Architecture issue]: Sprint [Y] - [solution]

## Risk Management
Based on audit findings:

### High-Risk Items
- [Critical issue from audit]: Mitigation in Sprint [X]
- [Blocking dependency]: Resolution approach

### Contingency Planning
- If [risk] occurs: [alternative approach]
- Sprint buffer: 20% capacity reserved

## Progress Tracking

### Sprint Velocity Targets
- Sprint 1: [Conservative due to fixes]
- Sprint 2-3: [Ramp up for features]
- Sprint 4+: [Steady state]

### Checkpoints
- Daily: Status updates
- Weekly: Sprint progress review
- Sprint End: Retrospective and audit comparison

## Post-MVP Roadmap
Features beyond MVP (from audit recommendations):
- [Enhancement 1]: Sprint [X]
- [Enhancement 2]: Sprint [Y]
