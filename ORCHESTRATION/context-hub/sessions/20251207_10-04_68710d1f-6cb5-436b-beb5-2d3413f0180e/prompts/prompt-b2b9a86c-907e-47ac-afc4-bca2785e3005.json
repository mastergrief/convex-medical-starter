    "description": "Implement Configurable Logging Metrics feature: Enable coaches to select which metrics athletes must log per exercise, bridging the gap between coach programming (10+ fields) and athlete logging (currently 3 hardcoded fields). Add loggingMetrics field to schema, wire backend mutations, create LoggingMetricsSelector UI component for coaches, update CategoryLoggingFields for dynamic athlete rendering."
